# `focusa_workpoint_checkpoint`

**Family:** `workpoint`  
**Label:** Workpoint Checkpoint

## Purpose

Create a typed Focusa Workpoint checkpoint before compaction, resume, context overflow, model switch, or risky continuation. Use this instead of trusting raw transcript memory; Focusa becomes the canonical continuation source and returns an explicit next-step hint.

## When to use

Use `focusa_workpoint_checkpoint` when its specific Focusa state or workflow surface is the narrowest tool that matches the current need. Prefer this tool over raw transcript memory when the result should survive compaction, be inspectable, or guide a later agent turn.

## When not to use

Do not use `focusa_workpoint_checkpoint` to dump unbounded logs, bypass operator steering, or create parallel memory outside Focusa. If the tool returns `pending`, `blocked`, `degraded`, or `canonical=false`, treat that as a recovery state and follow the returned next-step guidance.

## Example usage

```text
focusa_workpoint_checkpoint mission="Publish Focusa tool docs" current_action="docs_release" verified_evidence=["tools_in_src 43 missing_docs []"] next_action="commit and push" checkpoint_reason="manual" canonical=true
```

## Expected result

The tool should return a visible summary plus structured details. For Pi tools, inspect `details.tool_result_v1` when available for `status`, `canonical`, `degraded`, `retry`, `side_effects`, `evidence_refs`, and `next_tools`.

## Recovery notes

- If Focusa is unavailable, run `focusa_tool_doctor` or check `/v1/health`.
- If the result is non-canonical/degraded, call `focusa_workpoint_resume` or a relevant read tool before continuing.
- If writer ownership is involved, call `focusa_work_loop_writer_status` or use work-loop preflight first.
